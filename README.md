## How To Use The Client

Simply clone this repository and run `php client.php`. You can also provide optional arguments — use `php client.php help` to get list of them.

Once the client is running, you can send messages by typing them, but there are also commands, starting with a period (`.`) — type `.help` for a list of them. If you want to send a message starting with a period, use two periods.
