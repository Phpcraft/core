## Usage

If you're a PHP developer, feel free to clone this repository, `require "src/autoload.php";`, and feel free to use [the many available APIs](https://timmyrs.github.io/Phpcraft/namespacePhpcraft.html).

Otherwise, feel free to use the pre-made `client.php`, `server.php`, and `listping.php`. You can also provide arguments to the client and server; get a list of possible arguments using `php <file> help`. Also, the client has a couple of built-in commands â€” type `.help` in it for more information.
