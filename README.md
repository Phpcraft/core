# Phpcraft [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timmyrs/Phpcraft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timmyrs/Phpcraft)

A PHP library for all things Minecraft. Includes a pre-made client, server, and listping utility.

## Dependencies

Windows might work for some features, but it's not supported due to [a bug](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34972) and a general lack of features. Instead, use [the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://aka.ms/wslinstall).

For basic usage, all you need is PHP-CLI and mbstring:

	sudo apt-get -y install php php-cli php-mbstring

64-bit PHP at version 7.0.15 or above is recommended to avoid issues with some networking features.

If you want to join or host an online mode server, you'll also need GMP, OpenSSl, and mcrypt:

    sudo apt-get -y install php-gmp openssl php-dev php-xml gcc make autoconf libc-dev pkg-config libmcrypt-dev php-pear
    sudo pecl install mcrypt-1.0.1

## Using the Phpcraft client, server, or listping utility

Clone this repository, and then you can run the `client.php`, `server.php`, and `listping.php`. You can also provide arguments to the client and server; get a list of possible arguments using `php <file> help`. The client has a couple of built-in commands â€” type `.help` in it for more information.

## Using Phpcraft as a library

Thanks to [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), using Phpcraft as a library is really easy. Just head into your project folder, run `composer require timmyrs/phpcraft:dev-master`, and that's it; you can now `require "vendor/autoload.php";` to use [the many available APIs](https://timmyrs.github.io/Phpcraft/namespacePhpcraft.html).
